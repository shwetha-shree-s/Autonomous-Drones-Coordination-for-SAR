Developed a working model where we deployed a group of drones in the search and rescue missions. Based on a multi-agent actor-critic algorithm, the drones are trained in order to classify the objects and targets in a disaster environment. 
The corresponding environment is implemented in the AirSim simulator based on Unreal Engine 4. In the future, we want to enhance the performance of more agents involved in the scenario to decrease the rescue time and improve the probability of success of the SAR tasks
